# Personal Cursor Rules Collection

This is my personal collection of `.cursorrules` files that enhance the Cursor AI editor experience with custom rules and behaviors tailored to my development workflow.

## About Cursor Rules

`.cursorrules` files define custom rules for Cursor AI to follow when generating code, allowing for:
- Consistent coding styles and patterns
- Framework-specific best practices
- Custom behaviors and preferences
- Enhanced AI assistance tailored to specific project needs

## Usage

Place the appropriate `.cursorrules` file in your project's root directory to activate the custom rules for that project. Cursor AI will automatically detect and apply these rules when working in that project.
